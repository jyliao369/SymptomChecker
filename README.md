## Tests

The app can be tested in VS Code.

DISCLAIMER: Unfortunately, the application can't be operated constantly as the API authentication token changes after a certain period of time leaving only a small window of opportunity to operate before the token needs to be updated. There will be a small demonstration in the demonstration section to showcase the functionality of the application.
